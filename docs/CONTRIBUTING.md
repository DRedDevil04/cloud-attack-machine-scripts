2. **Feature Requests** - Suggest new VM types or tools
3. **Code Contributions** - Submit new scripts or improvements
4. **Documentation** - Improve guides and documentation
5. **Testing** - Test scripts on different environments

## üìã Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Linux/Unix systems
- Familiarity with bash scripting
- Understanding of cybersecurity tools
- Experience with package managers (apt, pip, npm, etc.)

### Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork locally**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-attack-machine-scripts.git
   cd cloud-attack-machine-scripts
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üîß Script Development Guidelines

### Script Structure

All setup scripts should follow this general structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script Name VM Setup Script
# Brief description of what this script does

set -e

echo "=========================================="
echo "Setting up [VM Type] VM"
echo "=========================================="

# Update system packages
echo "[+] Updating system packages..."
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install essential tools
echo "[+] Installing essential tools..."
# Installation commands here

# Configure tools
echo "[+] Configuring tools..."
# Configuration commands here

# Set up environment
echo "[+] Setting up environment..."
# Environment setup here

echo "=========================================="
echo "[VM Type] VM setup completed!"
echo "=========================================="
```

### Best Practices

#### 1. Error Handling
```bash
# Always use set -e for error handling
set -e

# Check command success when needed
if ! command -v tool &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Failed to install tool"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### 2. Progress Indicators
```bash
# Use clear progress indicators
echo "[+] Installing tools..."
echo "[+] Configuring services..."
echo "[+] Setting up environment..."
```

#### 3. Package Installation
```bash
# Group related packages
sudo apt install -y \
    package1 \
    package2 \
    package3

# Install Python packages to user directory
pip3 install --user package_name
```

#### 4. Directory Creation
```bash
# Create directories with proper permissions
mkdir -p ~/tools
mkdir -p ~/reports
```

#### 5. Service Management
```bash
# Enable and start services
sudo systemctl enable service_name
sudo systemctl start service_name
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Always validate downloads**
2. **Use official repositories when possible**
3. **Implement proper firewall rules**
4. **Follow principle of least privilege**
5. **Document security implications**

### Testing Requirements

Before submitting:

1. **Syntax Check**
   ```bash
   bash -n your-script.sh
   ```

2. **Test on Clean System**
   - Test on fresh Ubuntu/Debian installation
   - Document any prerequisites
   - Verify all tools install correctly

3. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Test on multiple Ubuntu/Debian versions
   - Verify cloud provider compatibility

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Script Documentation

Each script should include:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# VM Type Setup Script
# Detailed description of the script's purpose
# Author: Your Name
# Version: 1.0
# Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
#
# This script installs and configures:
# - Tool category 1 (tool1, tool2, tool3)
# - Tool category 2 (tool4, tool5)
# - Security configurations
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+
# - 2GB RAM minimum
# - Internet connection
# - Sudo privileges
#
# Usage:
# sudo ./setup-vmtype-vm.sh
```

### README Updates
